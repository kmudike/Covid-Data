## SQL-Data-Exploration-with-Covid-Data
The COVID-19 pandemic presented unprecedented challenges to global health systems, economies, and societies. With data scattered across various sources and in different formats, obtaining a cohesive understanding of the virus's impact has been a challenge. This project addresses the need for comprehensive analysis by:

Comparing the total number of cases to the total number of deaths to understand the lethality of the virus in different regions.

Analyzing vaccination progress across countries to gauge global efforts in achieving herd immunity.

Examining the correlation between population density and COVID-19 spread, aiming to provide insights into how geographical factors influence transmission rates.

 Covid Dataset: [link](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).

What are the questions being answered?

What is the country wise number of total cases and total deaths on each day reported?
What is the country wise percentage of population which contracted covid on each day reported?
Which are the countries with the highest infection rate with respect to the population?
Which are the countries with highest death count with respect to the population?
How much is the number of total cases, number of total deaths and percentages of death across the entire world on each date?
How much of the total number of people in the world that have been vaccinated by that date?
